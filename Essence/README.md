**Essence** is a lightweight, modern Essentials-style mod for Fabric servers.  
It provides all the quality-of-life utilities you expect built for performance, stability, and modded compatibility.

It focuses on simplicity, persistence, and integration with modern systems like the Fabric Permissions API and SQLite storage.

- Fully server-side ‚Äî no client mod required.  
- Safe, transactional SQLite database for player and location data.  
- Integrated permission handling with automatic fallback to vanilla op levels.  
- Command-based player utilities that work even for offline players.
